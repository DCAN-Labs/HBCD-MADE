Computational Requirements
--------------------------

The computational requirements for running HBCD-MADE depend on the input data (length of acquisition, number of channels, etc), along with the processing settings (down sampling, filtering, etc.). Because HBCD-MADE uses ICA, run time may vary for seemingly equivelant datasets. For an HBCD style acquisition (1kHz sampling rate, 129 electrodes) without down sampling, processing takes ~1 hour with ~3GB of RAM.
