Computational Requirements
--------------------------

The computational requirements for running HBCD-MADE depend on the amount of input data
(length of acquisition, number of channels, etc), along with the processing settings
(down sampling, filtering, etc.).

For an HBCD-style acquisition (1kHz sampling rate, 128 electrodes),
processing generally takes between one and three hours per session. HBCD-MADE internal processing is generally initiated with 2 CPUs, 40GB of RAM, and 7 hours of compute time.
