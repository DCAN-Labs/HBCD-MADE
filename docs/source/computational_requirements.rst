Computational Requirements
--------------------------

The computational requirements for running HBCD-MADE depend on the input data
(length of acquisition, number of channels, etc), along with the processing settings
(down sampling, filtering, etc.).

For an HBCD style acquisition (1kHz sampling rate, 129 electrodes),
processing generally takes between one and three hours. Within HBCD processing,
MADE is generally initiated with 2 CPUs, 40GB of RAM, and 7 hours of compute time.
